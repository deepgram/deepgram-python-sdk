```python
from deepgram import PrerecordedOptions

response = deepgram.listen.rest.v("1").transcribe_file(
    source=open("path/to/your/audio.wav", "rb"),
    options=PrerecordedOptions(model="nova-3") # Apply other options
)
```

[See our API reference for more info](https://developers.deepgram.com/reference/speech-to-text-api/listen).

[See the Example for more info](./examples/speech-to-text/rest/sync/file/main.py).

## Pre-Recorded (Asynchronous / Callbacks)

### Remote Files (Asynchronous)

Transcribe audio from a URL.

```python
from deepgram import PrerecordedOptions

response = deepgram.listen.rest.v("1").transcribe_url_async(
    source={"url": "https://dpgr.am/spacewalk.wav"},
    callback_url="https://your-callback-url.com/webhook",
    options=PrerecordedOptions(model="nova-3") # Apply other options
)
```

[See our API reference for more info](https://developers.deepgram.com/reference/speech-to-text-api/listen).

[See the Example for more info](./examples/speech-to-text/rest/async/url/main.py).

### Local Files (Asynchronous)

Transcribe audio from a file.

```python
from deepgram import PrerecordedOptions

response = deepgram.listen.rest.v("1").transcribe_file_async(
    source=open("path/to/your/audio.wav", "rb"),
    callback_url="https://your-callback-url.com/webhook",
    options=PrerecordedOptions(model="nova-3") # Apply other options
)
```

[See our API reference for more info](https://developers.deepgram.com/reference/speech-to-text-api/listen).

[See the Example for more info](./examples/speech-to-text/rest/async/file/main.py).

## Streaming Audio

Transcribe streaming audio.

```python
from deepgram import LiveOptions, LiveTranscriptionEvents

# Create a websocket connection
connection = deepgram.listen.websocket.v("1")

# Handle transcription events
@connection.on(LiveTranscriptionEvents.Transcript)
def handle_transcript(result):
    print(result.channel.alternatives[0].transcript)

# Start connection with streaming options
connection.start(LiveOptions(model="nova-3", language="en-US"))

# Send audio data
connection.send(open("path/to/your/audio.wav", "rb").read())

# Close when done
connection.finish()
```

[See our API reference for more info](https://developers.deepgram.com/reference/streaming-api).

[See the Examples for more info](./examples/speech-to-text/websocket/).

## Transcribing to Captions

Transcribe audio to captions.

### WebVTT

```python
from deepgram_captions import DeepgramConverter, webvtt

transcription = DeepgramConverter(dg_response)
captions = webvtt(transcription)
```

### SRT

```python
from deepgram_captions import DeepgramConverter, srt

transcription = DeepgramConverter(dg_response)
captions = srt(transcription)
```

[See our stand alone captions library for more information.](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-captions).

## Voice Agent

Configure a Voice Agent.

```python
from deepgram import (
    SettingsOptions
)

# Create websocket connection
connection = deepgram.agent.websocket.v("1")

# Configure agent settings
options = SettingsOptions()
options.language = "en"
options.agent.think.provider.type = "open_ai"
options.agent.think.provider.model = "gpt-4o-mini"
options.agent.think.prompt = "You are a helpful AI assistant."
options.agent.listen.provider.type = "deepgram"
options.agent.listen.provider.model = "nova-3"
options.agent.speak.provider.type = "deepgram"
options.agent.speak.provider.model ="aura-2-thalia-en"

options.greeting = "Hello, I'm your AI assistant."

# Start the connection
connection.start(options)

# Close the connection
connection.finish()
```

This example demonstrates:

- Setting up a WebSocket connection
- Configuring the agent with speech, language, and audio settings
- Handling various agent events (speech, transcripts, audio)
- Sending audio data and keeping the connection alive

For a complete implementation, you would need to:

1. Add your audio input source (e.g., microphone)
2. Implement audio playback for the agent's responses
3. Handle any function calls if your agent uses them
4. Add proper error handling and connection management

[See our API reference for more info](https://developers.deepgram.com/reference/voice-agent-api/agent).

[See the Examples for more info](./examples/agent/).

# Convert text to speech and save to file
response = deepgram.speak.rest.v("1").save(
    "output.mp3",
    {"text": "Hello world!"},
    options
)
```

[See our API reference for more info](https://developers.deepgram.com/reference/text-to-speech-api/speak).

[See the Example for more info](./examples/text-to-speech/rest/).

@connection.on(SpeakWebSocketEvents.AudioData)

# Configure streaming options
options = SpeakWSOptions(
    model="aura-2-thalia-en",
    encoding="linear16",
    sample_rate=16000
)

# Start connection and send text
connection.start(options)
connection.send_text("Hello, this is a text to speech example.")
connection.flush()
connection.wait_for_complete()

# Close when done
connection.finish()
```

## Pinning Versions

To ensure your application remains stable and reliable, we recommend using version pinning in your project. This is a best practice in Python development that helps prevent unexpected changes. You can pin to a major version (like `==4.*`) for a good balance of stability and updates, or to a specific version (like `==4.1.0`) for maximum stability. We've included some helpful resources about [version pinning](https://discuss.python.org/t/how-to-pin-a-package-to-a-specific-major-version-or-lower/17077) and [dependency management](https://www.easypost.com/dependency-pinning-guide) if you'd like to learn more. For a deeper understanding of how version numbers work, check out[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

In a `requirements.txt` file, you can pin to a specific version like this:

```sh
deepgram-sdk==4.1.0
```

Or using pip:

```sh
pip install deepgram-sdk==4.1.0
```

## Logging

This SDK provides logging as a means to troubleshoot and debug issues encountered. By default, this SDK will enable `Information` level messages and higher (ie `Warning`, `Error`, etc) when you initialize the library as follows:

```python
deepgram: DeepgramClient = DeepgramClient()
```

To increase the logging output/verbosity for debug or troubleshooting purposes, you can set the `DEBUG` level but using this code:

```python
config: DeepgramClientOptions = DeepgramClientOptions(
    verbose=logging.DEBUG,
)
deepgram: DeepgramClient = DeepgramClient("", config)
```

## Testing

### Daily and Unit Tests

If you are looking to use, run, contribute or modify to the daily/unit tests, then you need to install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

### Daily Tests

The daily tests invoke a series of checks against the actual/real API endpoint and save the results in the `tests/response_data` folder. This response data is updated nightly to reflect the latest response from the server. Running the daily tests does require a `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` set in your environment variables.

To run the Daily Tests:

```bash
make daily-test
```

#### Unit Tests

The unit tests invoke a series of checks against mock endpoints using the responses saved in `tests/response_data` from the daily tests. These tests are meant to simulate running against the endpoint without actually reaching out to the endpoint; running the unit tests does require a `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` set in your environment variables, but you will not actually reach out to the server.

```bash
make unit-test
```

## Backwards Compatibility

We follow semantic versioning (semver) to ensure a smooth upgrade experience. Within a major version (like `4.*`), we will maintain backward compatibility so your code will continue to work without breaking changes. When we release a new major version (like moving from `3.*` to `4.*`), we may introduce breaking changes to improve the SDK. We'll always document these changes clearly in our release notes to help you upgrade smoothly.

Older SDK versions will receive Priority 1 (P1) bug support only. Security issues, both in our code and dependencies, are promptly addressed. Significant bugs without clear workarounds are also given priority attention.

## Development and Contributing

Interested in contributing? We ❤️ pull requests!

To make sure our community is safe for all, be sure to review and agree to our
[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Then see the
[Contribution](CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines for more information.

In order to develop new features for the SDK itself, you first need to uninstall any previous installation of the `deepgram-sdk` and then install/pip the dependencies contained in the `requirements.txt` then instruct python (via pip) to use the SDK by installing it locally.

From the root of the repo, that would entail:

```bash
pip uninstall deepgram-sdk
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```
