## Pinning Versions
To ensure your application remains stable and reliable, we recommend using version pinning in your project. This is a best practice in Python development that helps prevent unexpected changes. You can pin to a major version (like `==4.*`) for a good balance of stability and updates, or to a specific version (like `==4.1.0`) for maximum stability. We've included some helpful resources about [version pinning](https://discuss.python.org/t/how-to-pin-a-package-to-a-specific-major-version-or-lower/17077) and [dependency management](https://www.easypost.com/dependency-pinning-guide) if you'd like to learn more. For a deeper understanding of how version numbers work, check out[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

In a `requirements.txt` file, you can pin to a specific version like this:

```sh
deepgram-sdk==4.1.0
```

Or using pip:

```sh
pip install deepgram-sdk==4.1.0
```

## Logging

This SDK provides logging as a means to troubleshoot and debug issues encountered. By default, this SDK will enable `Information` level messages and higher (ie `Warning`, `Error`, etc) when you initialize the library as follows:

```python
deepgram: DeepgramClient = DeepgramClient()
```

To increase the logging output/verbosity for debug or troubleshooting purposes, you can set the `DEBUG` level but using this code:

```python
config: DeepgramClientOptions = DeepgramClientOptions(
    verbose=logging.DEBUG,
)
deepgram: DeepgramClient = DeepgramClient("", config)
```

## Testing

### Daily and Unit Tests

If you are looking to use, run, contribute or modify to the daily/unit tests, then you need to install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

### Daily Tests

The daily tests invoke a series of checks against the actual/real API endpoint and save the results in the `tests/response_data` folder. This response data is updated nightly to reflect the latest response from the server. Running the daily tests does require a `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` set in your environment variables.

To run the Daily Tests:

```bash
make daily-test
```

#### Unit Tests

The unit tests invoke a series of checks against mock endpoints using the responses saved in `tests/response_data` from the daily tests. These tests are meant to simulate running against the endpoint without actually reaching out to the endpoint; running the unit tests does require a `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` set in your environment variables, but you will not actually reach out to the server.

```bash
make unit-test
```

## Backwards Compatibility

We follow semantic versioning (semver) to ensure a smooth upgrade experience. Within a major version (like `4.*`), we will maintain backward compatibility so your code will continue to work without breaking changes. When we release a new major version (like moving from `3.*` to `4.*`), we may introduce breaking changes to improve the SDK. We'll always document these changes clearly in our release notes to help you upgrade smoothly.

Older SDK versions will receive Priority 1 (P1) bug support only. Security issues, both in our code and dependencies, are promptly addressed. Significant bugs without clear workarounds are also given priority attention.

## Development and Contributing

Interested in contributing? We ❤️ pull requests!

To make sure our community is safe for all, be sure to review and agree to our
[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Then see the
[Contribution](CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines for more information.

In order to develop new features for the SDK itself, you first need to uninstall any previous installation of the `deepgram-sdk` and then install/pip the dependencies contained in the `requirements.txt` then instruct python (via pip) to use the SDK by installing it locally.

From the root of the repo, that would entail:

```bash
pip uninstall deepgram-sdk
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```
