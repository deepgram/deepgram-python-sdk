Official Python SDK for [Deepgram](https://www.deepgram.com/). Start building with our powerful transcription & speech understanding API.

> This SDK only supports hosted usage of api.deepgram.com.
## Getting an API Key

üîë To access the Deepgram API you will need a [free Deepgram API Key](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys).
## Documentation

Complete documentation of the Python SDK can be found at [Deepgram Docs](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/python-sdk).

You can learn more about the Deepgram API at [developers.deepgram.com](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs).

## Getting Started

```sh
pip install deepgram-sdk
```

## Usage

#### Transcribe an Existing File or Pre-recorded Audio

```python
from deepgram import Deepgram
import json

DEEPGRAM_API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
PATH_TO_FILE = 'some/file.wav'

def main():
    # Initializes the Deepgram SDK
    deepgram = Deepgram(DEEPGRAM_API_KEY)
    # Open the audio file
    with open(PATH_TO_FILE, 'rb') as audio:
        # ...or replace mimetype as appropriate
        source = {'buffer': audio, 'mimetype': 'audio/wav'}
        response = deepgram.transcription.sync_prerecorded(source, {'punctuate': True})
        print(json.dumps(response, indent=4))

main()
```

#### Transcribe an Existing File or Pre-recorded Audio Asynchronously

```python
from deepgram import Deepgram
import asyncio, json

DEEPGRAM_API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
PATH_TO_FILE = 'some/file.wav'

async def main():
    # Initializes the Deepgram SDK
    deepgram = Deepgram(DEEPGRAM_API_KEY)
    # Open the audio file
    with open(PATH_TO_FILE, 'rb') as audio:
        # ...or replace mimetype as appropriate
        source = {'buffer': audio, 'mimetype': 'audio/wav'}
        response = await deepgram.transcription.prerecorded(source, {'punctuate': True})
        print(json.dumps(response, indent=4))

asyncio.run(main())
```

#### Transcribe Audio in Real-Time or Streaming Audio

```python
from deepgram import Deepgram
import asyncio
import aiohttp

# Your Deepgram API Key
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'

# URL for the audio you would like to stream
# URL for the example resource will change depending on whether user is outside or inside the UK
# Outside the UK
URL = 'http://stream.live.vc.bbcmedia.co.uk/bbc_radio_fourlw_online_nonuk'
# Inside the UK
# URL = 'http://stream.live.vc.bbcmedia.co.uk/bbc_radio_fourfm'

async def main():
  # Initialize the Deepgram SDK
  deepgram = Deepgram(DEEPGRAM_API_KEY)

  # Create a websocket connection to Deepgram
  # In this example, punctuation is turned on, interim results are turned off, and language is set to US English.
  try:
    deepgramLive = await deepgram.transcription.live({ 'punctuate': True, 'interim_results': False, 'language': 'en-US' })
  except Exception as e:
    print(f'Could not open socket: {e}')
    return

# Listen for the connection to close
  deepgramLive.registerHandler(deepgramLive.event.CLOSE, lambda c: print(f'Connection closed with code {c}.'))

  # Listen for any transcripts received from Deepgram and write them to the console
  deepgramLive.registerHandler(deepgramLive.event.TRANSCRIPT_RECEIVED, print)

  # Listen for the connection to open and send streaming audio from the URL to Deepgram
  async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
    async with session.get(URL) as audio:
      while True:
        data = await audio.content.readany()
        deepgramLive.send(data)

        # If there's no data coming from the livestream then break out of the loop
        if not data:
            break

  # Indicate that we've finished sending data by sending the customary zero-byte message to the Deepgram streaming endpoint, and wait until we get back the final summary metadata object
  await deepgramLive.finish()

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Parameters

Query parameters like `punctuate` are added as part of the `TranscriptionOptions` `dict` in the `.prerecorded`/`.live` transcription call.
Multiple query parameters can be added similarly, and any dict will do - the types are provided for reference/convenience.
```python
response = await dg_client.transcription.prerecorded(source, {'punctuate': True, 'keywords': ['first:5', 'second']})
```
Depending on your preference, you can also add parameters as named arguments, instead.
```python
response = await dg_client.transcription.prerecorded(source, punctuate=True, keywords=['first:5', 'second'])
```

## Code Samples

To run the sample code, you may want to create a virtual environment to isolate your Python projects, but it's not required. You can learn how to make and activate these virtual environments in [this article](https://blog.deepgram.com/python-virtual-environments/) on our Deepgram blog.

#### Streaming Audio Code Samples

In the `sample-projects` folder, there are examples from four different Python web frameworks of how to do live streaming audio transcription with Deepgram. These include:

- Flask 2.0
- FastAPI
- Django
- Quart
