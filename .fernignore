# Custom WebSocket transport support:
# - transport_interface.py: Protocol definitions (SyncTransport, AsyncTransport) for
#   users implementing custom transports. This is the public-facing interface file.
# - transport.py: Internal shims, install/restore helpers, and conflict guard.
# Both are manually maintained and should not be regenerated.
