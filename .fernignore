# WireMock mappings manually fixed to handle x-fern-sdk-method-name attribute
# Generator doesn't properly handle this attribute, so mappings must be manually maintained

# Custom client implementation extending BaseClient with additional features:
# - access_token parameter support (Bearer token authentication)
# - Automatic session ID generation and header injection (x-deepgram-session-id)
# This file is manually maintained and should not be regenerated

# Wire test files with manual fixes to correct generator output:
# - test_listen_v1_media.py: Fixed transcribe_file() call to pass required request parameter (bytes)
# - test_speak_v1_audio.py: Fixed generate() call to consume iterator for request completion
# - conftest.py: Changed from generated DeepgramApi to BaseClient for WireMock compatibility

# WebSocket socket client files with manual fixes for binary audio data support:
# The generator incorrectly types \*\_media methods as `str` and uses `_send_model()` which
# calls `.dict()` on the input, causing runtime errors. These files are manually fixed to:
# 1. Change parameter type from `str` to `bytes` for all `*_media` methods
# 2. Change from `_send_model()` to `_send()` to properly handle binary data

# Reason: Audio data must be sent as binary bytes, not strings. The `_send_model()` method
# expects Pydantic models and calls `.dict()` which fails on bytes/str. The `_send()` method
# properly handles bytes by passing them directly to the websocket connection.
