# WireMock mappings manually fixed to handle x-fern-sdk-method-name attribute

# Custom client implementation extending BaseClient with additional features:
# - access_token parameter support (Bearer token authentication)
# - Automatic session ID generation and header injection (x-deepgram-session-id)
# This file is manually maintained and should not be regenerated

# Wire test files with manual fixes to correct generator output:
# - test_listen_v1_media.py: Fixed transcribe_file() call to pass required request parameter (bytes)
# - test_speak_v1_audio.py: Fixed generate() call to consume iterator for request completion
# - conftest.py: Changed from generated DeepgramApi to BaseClient for WireMock compatibility

# Wire tests __init__.py with Python 3.8-3.10 datetime.fromisoformat compatibility fix:
# The Fern generator creates test files that use datetime.fromisoformat() with ISO 8601 strings
# ending in 'Z' (e.g., '2024-01-15T09:30:00Z'). However, Python 3.10's datetime.fromisoformat()
# doesn't support the 'Z' suffix (this was added in Python 3.11). Python 3.8 and 3.9 also lack
# this support.
#
# Rather than modifying generated test files (which would be overwritten on regeneration), we
# implement a monkey-patch in tests/wire/__init__.py that wraps the datetime.datetime class
# and overrides fromisoformat() to automatically convert 'Z' to '+00:00' before calling the
# original implementation.
#
# This ensures:
# 1. Generated test files remain unchanged and can be regenerated without conflicts
# 2. All wire tests pass on Python 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10 (as well as 3.11+)
# 3. The fix is transparent to all code importing datetime.datetime in the wire tests module
#
# The implementation uses a wrapper class that inherits from the original datetime class,
# ensuring all other datetime functionality remains unchanged. The wrapper is injected into
# sys.modules['datetime'].datetime so that any 'from datetime import datetime' statements
# in the wire tests will get the patched version.

# WebSocket socket client files with manual fixes for binary audio data support:
# The generator incorrectly types \*\_media methods as `str` and uses `_send_model()` which
# calls `.dict()` on the input, causing runtime errors. These files are manually fixed to:
# 1. Change parameter type from `str` to `bytes` for all `*_media` methods
# 2. Change from `_send_model()` to `_send()` to properly handle binary data

#
# Reason: Audio data must be sent as binary bytes, not strings. The `_send_model()` method
# expects Pydantic models and calls `.dict()` which fails on bytes/str. The `_send()` method
# properly handles bytes by passing them directly to the websocket connection.
