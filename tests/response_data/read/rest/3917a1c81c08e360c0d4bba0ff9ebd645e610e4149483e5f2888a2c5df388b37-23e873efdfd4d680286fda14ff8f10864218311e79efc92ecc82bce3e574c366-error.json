{"actual": "The potential for voice-based interfaces in conversational AI applications is discussed, with a focus on voice-premises and wearable devices. The success of voice-first experiences and tools, including DeepgramQuad, is highlighted, with a focus on improving customer outcomes and speed and efficiency for everyday exchanges. The speakers emphasize the benefits of voice quality, including natural speech flow, and the potential for AI agents to be more human than humans in speech recognition, including the use of natural voices and audio to create voice-like experiences. They also mention their involvement in machine learning and their plans to expand their waitlist for a speech-to-text model. They expect to release generally early next year, but if working on any real-time AI agent use cases, they can join their waitlist to jumpstart their development in production.", "expected": ["*"]}
